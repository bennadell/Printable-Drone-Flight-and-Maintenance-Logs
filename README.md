# Printable Drone Flight and Maintenance Logs
Here are some printable custom logsheets for use as a flight log and maintenance log for FAA Part 107 Certificated Pilots. 

You can print them on regular paper, hole-punch them, and add them to a binder as needed. 

I hope that the fields included will encourage thorough pre- and post-flight checks of all relevant conditions, and encourage detailed accountings of your flights and your sUAS's performance, while simplifying the actual process of recording things.
